1.) You are on a game show and given the choice of whatever is behind three doors. Behind one door is a fantastic prize (some examples use a car, others use cash) while behind the other two doors is a dud (some examples say a goat, others say it's just empty). You pick a door. Then the host opens one of the other two doors to reveal a dud. But here's the wrinkle: the host now gives you the opportunity to switch your door. What should you do?
  
    My initial answer is to not switch.   
    
    The P(Winning No Change) is 1/3.  There are only three outcomes Winnning, Choosing Losing Door 1 and Choosing Losing Door 2.
    
    When you change there are the same amount of outcomes but there are more paths to get to those outcomes.
    
    1. Originally Choosing Winning --> Switch to Losing Door 1
    2. Originally Choosing Winning --> Switch to Losing Door 2
    3. Originally Choosing Losing Door 1 --> Switch to Losing Door 2
    4. Originally Choosing Losing Door 1 --> Switch to Winning
    5. Originally Choosing Losing Door 2 --> Switch to Losing Door 1
    6. Originally Choosing Losing Door 2 --> Switch to Winning 
    
    When you switch you introduce Bayes probabilities, for you to win when you swtich you have to find the probability of
    swtiching to the winning door given that you originally chose a losing door. But the probability still comes out to .3333, 
    where .66666 is the probability of choosing a wrong door and then .5 chance of choosing the correct door.  
    .6666 * .5 = .3333.
