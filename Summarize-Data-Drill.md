1.) Greg was 14, Marcia was 12, Peter was 11, Jan was 10, Bobby was 8, and Cindy was 6 when they started playing the Brady kids on The Brady Bunch. Cousin Oliver was 8 years old when he joined the show. What are the mean, median, and mode of the kids' ages when they first appeared on the show? What are the variance, standard deviation, and standard error?

    Mean = (14 + 12 + 11 + 10 + 8 + 6 + 8)/7 = 9.857
    
    14, 12, 11, 10, 8, 8, 6, The median number is 10
    
    Mode = 8
    
    Variance:
    
    14-9.857 = 4.143, 4.143^2 = 17.164
    12-9.857 = 2.143, 2.143^2 = 4.592
    11-9.857 = 1.143, 1.143^2 = 1.306
    10-9.857 = 0.143, 0.143^2 = .020
    8-9.857 = -1.857, -1.867^2 = 3.448
    8-9.857 = -1.857, -1.867^2 = 3.448
    6-9.857 = -3.857, -3.857^2 = 14.876
    
    17.164 + 4.592 + 1.306 + 0.020 + 3.448 + 3.448 + 14.876 = 44.854
    
    44.854 / (7-1) = 7.476
    
    Standard Deviation:
    
    Variance ^ 0.5 = 2.734
    
    Standard Error:
    
    std / (7 ^ 0.5) = 1.033
    
2.) Using these estimates, if you had to choose only one estimate of central tendency and one estimate of variance to describe the data, which would you pick and why?

    I would use mean and std as the estimate for central tendency and variance respectively.  I believe these measures represent the dataset well. 

3.) Next, Cindy has a birthday. Update your estimates- what changed, and what didn't?

   
    Mean = (14 + 12 + 11 + 10 + 8 + 7 + 8)/7 = 10
    
    14, 12, 11, 10, 8, 8, 7, The median number is 10
    
    Mode = 8
    
    Variance:
    
    14-9.857 = 4.143, 4.143^2 = 17.164
    12-9.857 = 2.143, 2.143^2 = 4.592
    11-9.857 = 1.143, 1.143^2 = 1.306
    10-9.857 = 0.143, 0.143^2 = .020
    8-9.857 = -1.857, -1.867^2 = 3.448
    8-9.857 = -1.857, -1.867^2 = 3.448
    7-9.857 = -3.857, -2.857^2 = 8.162
    
    17.164 + 4.592 + 1.306 + 0.020 + 3.448 + 3.448 + 8.162 = 38.14
    
    38.14 / (7-1) = 6.357
    
    Standard Deviation:
    
    Variance ^ 0.5 = 2.521
    
    Standard Error:
    
    std / (7 ^ 0.5) = 0.953
    
    The median and the mode did not change.  Everything else changed (Mean, Variance, Standard Deviation, and Standard Error).
    

4.) Nobody likes Cousin Oliver. Maybe the network should have used an even younger actor. Replace Cousin Oliver with 1-year-old Jessica, then recalculate again. Does this change your choice of central tendency or variance estimation methods?

    Mean = (14 + 12 + 11 + 10 + 8 + 7 + 1)/7 = 9
    
    14, 12, 11, 10, 8, 7, 1, The median number is 10
    
    Mode = None 
    
    Variance:
    
    14-9.857 = 4.143, 4.143^2 = 17.164
    12-9.857 = 2.143, 2.143^2 = 4.592
    11-9.857 = 1.143, 1.143^2 = 1.306
    10-9.857 = 0.143, 0.143^2 = .020
    8-9.857 = -1.857, -1.867^2 = 3.448
    7-9.857 = -3.857, -2.857^2 = 8.162
    1-9.857 = -8.857, -8.857^2 = 78.446
    
    17.164 + 4.592 + 1.306 + 0.020 + 3.448 + 8.162 + 78.446 = 113.138
    
    113.138 / (7-1) = 18.856
    
    
    Standard Deviation:
    
    Variance ^ 0.5 = 4.342
    
    Standard Error:
    
    std / (7 ^ 0.5) = 1.641
    
    No, this doesn't change my choice of central tendency or variance methods

5.) On the 50th anniversary of The Brady Bunch, four different magazines asked their readers whether they were fans of the show. The answers were: TV Guide 20% fans Entertainment Weekly 23% fans Pop Culture Today 17% fans SciPhi Phanatic 5% fans
Based on these numbers, what percentage of adult Americans would you estimate were Brady Bunch fans on the 50th anniversary of the show?

    Mean:
    
    (20 + 23 + 17 + 5) / 4 = 16.25
    
    Variance:
    
    20 - 16.25 = 3.75, 3.75^2 = 14.0625
    
    23 - 16.25 = 6.75, 6.75^2 = 45.5625
    
    17 - 16.25 = .75, .75^2 = .5625
    
    5 - 16.25 = -11.25, -11.25^2 = 126.5625
    
    (14.0625 + 45.5625 + .5625 + 126.5625) / (4 - 1) = 62.25
    
    Standard Deviation:
    
    Variance ^ 0.5 = 7.89
    
    Standard Error:
    
    Std / (4 ^ 0.5) = 3.945
    
    I would estimate that 16.25% +- 3.945% of adult Americans are fans of the Brady Bunch
