1.) Describe your ideal job in one or two paragraphs as though you're talking with an industry professional. They're familiar with the business and with the culture, they know the jargon and the buzzwords. Focus on the skills, tools, and / or industry you hope to deeply specialize in.

     My ideal job would be a Data Scientist for a company that is helping a noble cause.  I would like to be involved in creating Neural
     Networks utilizing TensorFlow, analyzing data and employing machine learning with massive sets of data.  I would like to work
     with cloud computing such as AWS or Google Cloud.  I would like to be creating and sharing visualizations of data for employees of the company via
     Tableau.  I would definitely like to work for a company that empowers employees to work freely on projects and collaboratively with other teams/departments.
     
2.) Describe your ideal job in one or two paragraphs as though you're talking with a non-technical family member or friend. Avoid jargon and keep things simple while remaining specific. If you went deep in your specialization above, emphasize here the breadth of skills and work.

    My ideal job would be a Data Scientist for a company that is helping a noble cause.  I would like to be analyzing and visualizing large datasets.  
    I want to be able to derive insight from large amounts of data and have company decision makers employ that insight on key decisions.  I want to help
    the company with predictions via data analysis so they can be proactive in their decisions.  I want to work collaboratively with all stakeholders at all levels of the 
    company.  
    
3.) Synthesize the two exercises above into a short aspirational "professional summary" that might be appropriate on your LinkedIn profile, resume, or portfolio in the future.

    I aspire to be a Data Scientist in a company that is helping to solve some of the world's most critical problems.  I would like to employ Data Science for the
    benefit of the world.  I want to use the most cutting edge of technology and data science toolsets to help combat the world's problems.  I want to work collaboratively at
    all levels of the company: from the boots-on-the-ground worker to the C-level suite executive in helping derive insight from data.
