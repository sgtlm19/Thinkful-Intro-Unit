A diagnostic test has a 98% probability of giving a positive result when applied to a person suffering from Thripshaw's Disease, and 10% probability of giving a (false) positive when applied to a non-sufferer. It is estimated that 0.5 % of the population are sufferers. Suppose that the test is now administered to a person whose disease status is unknown. Calculate the probability that the test will:

1.) Be Positive

    We need to find the probabilities of the two conditions of being positive P(Positive|Infected) and P(Positive|Not Infected):
    
    P(Positive|Infected) = .98 * .005 = .0049
    P(Positive|Not Infected) = .1 * .995 = .0995
    .0049 + .0995 = 0.1485 = 14.85%

2.) Correctly diagnose a sufferer of Thripshaw's

    Probability is .98 or 98%

3.) Correctly identify a non-sufferer of Thripshaw's

    P(Negative|Not Infected) = .995 * .9 = .08955 = 89.55%

4.) Misclassify a person

    We need to find the probabilities of the two conditions of misclassification P(Negative|Infected) and P(Positive|Not Infected):
    
    P(Negative|Infected) = .02
    P(Positive|Not Infected) = .1
    .02 + .1 = .12 = 12%
