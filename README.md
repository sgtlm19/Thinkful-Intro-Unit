# Thinkful-Visualization-Challenge

This notebook is for the Thinkful Visualization Challenge.  I used the Global Terrorism dataset from the Kaggle site to do this challenge.  I focused on analyzing terrorist deaths.  I looked at the overall terrorist deaths over time, I looked at the deadliest regions, I looked at the top three deadliest regions, and I looked at Iraq's (the deadliest country) deaths over time.
