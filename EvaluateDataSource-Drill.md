In each of the scenarios, find possible shortcomings of the data sources to answer the given question. What could be done to either adjust the analysis or reframe the question so that you can answer it accurately?

1.) **Data Source**: Amsterdam availability data scraped from AirBnB on December 24th. **Question**: What are the popular neighborhoods in Amsterdam?
     
     The data source is scraped on Dec. 24th, the day before Christmas.  I believe that data taken from a day before a holiday will not be representive of the other days.
     I would take samples of random days throughout the year from AirBnB for Amsterdam. 

2.) **Data Source**: Mental health services use on September 12, 2001 in San Francisco, CA and New York City, NY. **Question**: How do patterns of mental health service use vary between cities?

    The data source is from Sept. 12 2001, which is one day after the 9/11 terrorist attack.  I would believe the use of mental health services 
    for New York City, NY after the 9/11 terroist attack would be representative for a typical day.  I would again take samples of random days
    throughout the year for each city and I would include other cities.

3.) **Data Source**: Armenian Pub Survey. **Question**: What are the most common reasons Armenians visit local pubs?

    Looking at the column metrics of the data for the survery, 70% of the survey participants are students.  This data can't be 
    representative of the Armenian population as a whole.  The question could be reframed as "of all the Armenian people who visit 
    the pub, what are the common reasons for visiting the local pub?"
